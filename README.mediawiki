This project aims to be an open source implementation of the
maximal information coefficient measure, a measure of two-variable
dependence designed for the exploration of many-dimensional data sets.

For more information on the measure see the
[http://www.exploredata.net/ web site] created by the
team that came up with the measure and the corresponding
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1205438 article] they
published in ''Science''.

Currently the code implements all the algorithms listed in the
article, compiles, and passes all unit tests.

Things that remain to be done are:
* Correct the implementation to produce results close to those of the original implementation
* Optimize the algorithm through aggressive caching
* Explore other methods to obtain better results in less time
